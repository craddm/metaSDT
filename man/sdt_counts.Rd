\title{Convert trial-by-trial data to counts.}
\usage{
sdt_counts(df, stimulus = NULL, response = NULL, split_resp = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Data frame containing single trial data.}

\item{stimulus}{Bare column name that contains the stimulus grouping of the
trial (e.g. present versus absent).}

\item{response}{Bare column name that contains the response to be totalled
over. (e.g. yes or no or any combination of confidence and response.)}

\item{split_resp}{Defaults to TRUE. Splits the counts into two columns, one
for each stimulus.}
}
\description{
Reduces a trial-by-trial data frame to counts.
}
\details{
Intended mainly for use with the type 2 SDT fit_meta_d_MLE, fit_meta_d_SSE,
and fit_meta_d_bal functions. By default it will split the totals into
multiple columns, one for each stimulus, with each row the total for a
possible response. It is currently expected that confidence and response are
combined into a single column  i.e. Response = "Definitely yes, maybe yes,
maybe no, definitely no". Separate columns for confidence and response are
not currently supported, but may be in the future.
