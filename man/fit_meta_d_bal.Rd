\title{Meta-d' balance calculation}
\usage{
fit_meta_d_bal(nr_s1, nr_s2, s = 1, add_constant = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{nr_s1}{Responses to S1 stimulus. See below for advice.}

\item{nr_s2}{Responses to S2 stimulus. See below for advice.}

\item{s}{Ratio of standard deviations for the S1 and S2 stimulus. Defaults to
1.}

\item{add_constant}{Add a small constant to all cells to adjust for boundary
issues, and for consistency with the use of this method with other meta-d
measures. Note: default for this is FALSE.}
}
\description{
The expected input is two vectors, one for responses to each stimulus,
encoding the observers response and confidence. For example, for two stimului
labelled A and B, with three confidence ratings, participants could respond
to stimulus A as follows: Response: A, rating: 3, count: 60 Response: A,
rating: 2, count: 30 Response: A, rating: 1, count: 10 Response: B, rating:
1, count: 7 Response: B, rating: 2, count: 4 Response: B, rating: 3, count: 1
}
\details{
The appropriate vector would be nr_s1 <- c(60,30,10,7,4,1)

For stimulus B, we would have the respective vector for responses to stimulus
B, eg: Response: A, rating: 3, count: 4 Response: A, rating: 2, count: 6
Response: A, rating: 1, count: 11 Response: B, rating: 1, count: 13 Response:
B, rating: 2, count: 23 Response: B, rating: 3, count: 61

nr_s2 <- c(4,6,11,13,23,61)
}
\examples{
nr_s1 <- c(60,30,10,7,4,1)
nr_s2 <- c(4,6,11,13,23,61)
fit_meta_d_bal(nr_s1, nr_s2)
}
