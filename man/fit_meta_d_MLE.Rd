\title{Fit Type 2 SDT using Maximum Likelihood Estimation.}
\usage{
fit_meta_d_MLE(nr_s1, nr_s2, s = 1, add_constant = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{nr_s1}{Responses to S1 stimulus. See below for advice.}

\item{nr_s2}{Responses to S2 stimulus. See below for advice.}

\item{s}{Ratio of standard deviations for the S1 and S2 stimulus. Defaults to
1.}

\item{add_constant}{Adds a small constant to the data (1/number of possible
responses) to account for 0 or 1 values. Defaults to TRUE for ease of use
across multiple datasets.}
}
\description{
Provides a type-2 SDT analysis of data from a typical experiment in which
observers discriminate between two response alternatives and provide ratings
of confidence in their judgements.
}
\details{
The expected input is two vectors, one for responses to each stimulus,
encoding the observers response and confidence. For example, for two stimului
labelled A and B, with three confidence ratings, participants could respond
to stimulus A as follows:

Response: A, rating: 3, count: 60

Response: A, rating: 2, count: 30

Response: A, rating: 1, count: 10

Response: B, rating: 1, count: 7

Response: B, rating: 2, count: 4

Response: B, rating: 3, count: 1

The appropriate vector would be nr_s1 <- c(60,30,10,7,4,1)

For stimulus B, we would have the respective vector for responses to stimulus
B, eg:

Response: A, rating: 3, count: 4

Response: A, rating: 2, count: 6

Response: A, rating: 1, count: 11

Response: B, rating: 1, count: 13

Response: B, rating: 2, count: 23

Response: B, rating: 3, count: 61

nr_s2 <- c(4,6,11,13,23,61)

The helper function \code{sdt_counts} can be used to get the data into the
right format.

The output is a data frame with various metacognitive measures, including
m-ratio and meta-d, estimated using Maximum Likelihood Estimation. The output
will have n-1 rows, where n is the number of confidence ratings. Most
measures are duplicated across rows, but some vary, as they reflect cutpoints
between the confidence levels.
